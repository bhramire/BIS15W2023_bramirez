## Review from last time
### *With a partner, discuss the following questions*
1. What is a pipe? Why are they useful in R
Allows you to combine functions
2. What is the shortcut for making a pipe?
Ctrl + Shift + M
3. What is the difference between `select`, `filter`, and `mutate`?
4. What are the logistics of midterm 1?

### Warm-up
1. Open the data `ecs21351-sup-0003-SupplementS1.csv`
```{r}
 ecosphere<-readr::read_csv("data/ecs21351-sup-0003-SupplementS1.csv", skip = 2)
```

2. Clean the names of the variables
```{r}
names(ecosphere)
ecosphere <- clean_names(ecosphere)
```

3. Explore the data using a function of your choice
```{r}
glimpse(ecosphere)
```

4. Are there more veggie, omni, insecivore, or nectar feeders in the data?
```{r}
ecosphere %>% 
  tabyl(diet) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

5. Which families are Veggie?
```{r}
ecosphere %>% 
  filter(diet == "Vegetation") %>% 
  select(family, diet) %>% 
  tabyl(diet)
```
