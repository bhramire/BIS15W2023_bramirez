BIS 015L Repository 
Hello! My name is Benjamin Ramirez. I'm a second year Global Disease Biology Major. I am taking this class because someone once referred to my older brother as an 'R Wizard' and that's a killer title. This repository will contain all of my class work and projects. You can reach me at bhramirez@ucdavis.edu. Thanks for stopping by!
