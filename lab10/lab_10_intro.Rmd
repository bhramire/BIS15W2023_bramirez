## Seating & Set-up
1. Please make sure that you sit next to your group members for the rest of the quarter.
2. Please set-up your computer as normal.

## Warm-up
1. Please load the homerange data `Tamburelloetal_HomeRangeDatabase.csv`
2. Show the min, mean, and max log10.mass by taxonomic class in the dataset.
3. Make a plot that best summarizes this output.
```{r}
homerange <-read_csv(here("data","Tamburelloetal_HomeRangeDatabase.csv"))
```
```{r}
names(homerange)
```

```{r}
homerange %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarise( min_mass = min(log10.mass), 
             max_mass = max(log10.mass),
             mean_mass = mean(log10.mass))

 
```
```{r}
 homerange %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x=class, y= log10.mass))+geom_boxplot()
```
